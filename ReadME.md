This is a fun and simple weather viewer application, marking my second project in C. In this project, I had the opportunity to work with the Raylib graphics library for creating the user interface and the libcurl library for fetching weather data.

## Features:

- **Weather Data:** Retrieve real-time weather information for a specified location.
- **Graphical Interface:** Designed using the Raylib library, providing an interactive and visually appealing user experience.
- **Data Fetching:** Utilizes libcurl to fetch weather data from online APIs.

Happy coding!
